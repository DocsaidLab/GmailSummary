## Introduction

In everyday life, we often start receiving updates from a GitHub project when we click the `Watch` button on its page. These updates include, but are not limited to, discussions on new features, issue reports, pull requests (PRs), and bug reports.

For example, if you are watching some GitHub projects and have chosen the "All Activity" watch mode:

- [**albumentations**](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations): You might receive about 10 emails per day.
- [**onnxruntime**](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime): You might receive up to 200 emails per day.

Imagine if you were watching 10 more projects; you would receive 1,000 emails every day.

Therefore, as engineers seeking efficiency (or perhaps a bit of laziness), we must think about how to solve this problem.
